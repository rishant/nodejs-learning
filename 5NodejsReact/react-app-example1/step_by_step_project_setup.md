# we need to  uninstall create-react-app globally.
> npm uninstall -g create-react-app


### Step : 1 - Create React application using create-react-app template.
> npx create-react-app react-app-example1
> ![img_png](img1.PNG) ![img_png](img2.PNG)

> # React App Folder Structure: 
> application dependency [npm command] file : package.json \
> public page [Start] : public/index.html \
> application folder [root] : src \
> application Base [page] : src/index.js \
> application Base [component] : App.js

> Components are the building blocks of React Application. \
> Components are reusable and can be nested in other components 
> # 2 Types of components:
> - Functional components
> - class based components

> JSX - Javascript-XML Template Engine.
> # JSX Restrictions:
> - className we can't use because of javascript keyword.
> - 1 parent container should present for all JSX elements.
> - functional components are not needed explicitly import React class.

# Request Workflow from Client -To- Server
> http://localhost:3000 \
>  ->   public/index.html (root div)\
>  -->  src\index.js (render App component into root div)\
>  ---> src\App.js ( Props, State, component events load/change/destroy, JSX template )
